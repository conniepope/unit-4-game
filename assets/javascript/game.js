// FUNCTIONS

// GAME START / RESET

// At the start of game:

// A random number between 19 - 120 is displayed

wins = 0;
losses = 0;
score = 0;

// each crystal gets a random value between 1 - 12 

// GAME PLAY

//    * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

//      * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
//      * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

//    * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

//    * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

//    * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

//      * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

//    * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses.
